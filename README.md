# Superstore-Sales-Data-Analysis

I performed data analysis on a dataset which contains the information/entries like profits, quantities, orders etc for the years 2019 and 2020.
Used Power BI platform to create an interactive dashboard with KPIs, donut charts, line charts etc. Extracted top 3 categories and subcategories to understand the total profit, orders, and sales in four regsions of U.S: Central, East, South, West
